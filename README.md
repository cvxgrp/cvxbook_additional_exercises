# cvxbook_additional_exercises
This repo contain additional exercises and data files in Python, Julia, and Matlab for Stanford [EE364a, 
Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/), that do not appear in the book 
[Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/).

It is updated after each quarter the course is taught, so the exercise numbers can change.

Instructors can request the solutions by emailing the authors.  Please
include a link to your course.
